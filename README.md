- 👋 Hi, I’m @oc316
- 👀 I’m interested in architecture - enterprise, solution, application, data, integration
- 🌱 I’ve recently created a react OCR app to read animal tags from photos.  
      I have also created a simple data pipeline to extract master data in formats like csv, json or sqlite and hosting these extracts 
      on AWS S3 buckets (which I created using terraform) and available for downstream apps to consume.
- 💞️ I’ve designed mobile sync solutions and am currently working on an ERP migration, defining an Azure integration platform with APIs to enable this.
- 📫 Currently catch me at owen.christie@callaghaninnovation.govt.nz
